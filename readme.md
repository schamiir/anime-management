## Lessons Learned


I learned a deeper understaning on building APIs and implement the four basic types of functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete). CRUD corresponds to the HTTP methods, POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.

I also learned how to create a cluster within MongoDB server and build our app in a way that the user can search their favorite anime and retrive the data in order to track their progress. Then once the user is done with the anime, they can go ahead and delete and repeat this process.
